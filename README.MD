# Reinforcement Learning
This repo showcases my work exploring different algorithms of RL and their applications. 


### Tutorials
1. This tutorial discusses the ICM model as an example of curiosty-driven learning specifically for the mountain car probelm. Read more on my medium post [Curiosity-Driven Learning with OpenAI and Keras](https://medium.com/@gili.karni/curiosity-driven-learning-with-openai-and-keras-66f2c7f091fa?source=friends_link&sk=4ad141db7b3c20d2ebfdbd9c6b14bb35). Or find the full python code [here](https://github.com/karnigili/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/ICM.ipynb).

2. This tutorial introduces policy gradient algorithms and provides a keras implementation of a deep REINFORCE model. Read more on my medium post [Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning with Keras](https://medium.com/swlh/policy-gradient-reinforcement-learning-with-keras-57ca6ed32555?source=friends_link&sk=453cf920e6c8fe256a91360d728d7ebd). Or find the full python code [here](https://github.com/karnigili/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/REINFORCE.ipynb). 


### Udacity Deep-RL
1. The first project of the Udacity deep-RL course focuses on Value-based algorithms. Here, I solve the Unity Banana-Navigation task using DQN and PyTorch. See the full python code with accompanying explanations [here](https://github.com/karnigili/ReinforcementLearning/tree/master/Udacity-Deep-RL/DQN).
